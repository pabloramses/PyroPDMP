# PyroPDMP

PyroPDMP is an in development repository built on [Pyro](https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro) that implements the simulation of [Piece-wise Deterministic Markov Processes](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26771007) as a continuous-time Monte Carlo-Markov Chain method for Bayesian Inference, using the flexibility to define models without the need to specify gradients that Pyro provides.
